							<p>
							Equal parts graphic designer, web developer, and illustrator, I combine an appreciation for the playful with the professional. I take pride in translating client needs into clean, purposeful designs.</p>
							<p>
							Visual arts isn’t my job, it’s my passion—a passion born the moment I put crayon to paper as a child. While winning the coloring contest nearly every week in 1st grade didn’t necessarily make me the most popular kid in the class, it did plant the notion that work could be fun.</p>
							<p>
							These days I spend my time doing what I love as the Creative Director at Scentco, Inc.  Myself, along with my team of 7 designers, help create the face for the Scentco, Inc. brand. Anywhere from the websites to the packaging you can usually find me brainstorming up some new idea to help move the company forward. My insatiable desire to design has also spilled over into my evenings on numerous freelance projects. I enjoy getting the opportunity to work with clients from different industries and markets. It helps keep my design both versatile and up to date. Prior to joining the Scentco, Inc. team I cut my teeth at the Art Institute of California – San Diego.</p>
							<p>
							My passion for visual arts is infused into all areas of my life. When I’m not pushing pixels for pay, you’re likely to find me walking Pixel–my wiry-haired rescue dog. You’ll know it’s me by the Pantone book tattooed on my arm-turned-canvas. I also really enjoy trying new restaurants and I am not ashamed to admit that I have been known to select a dining spot based on its logo design.
